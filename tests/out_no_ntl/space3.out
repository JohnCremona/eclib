Subspace test program with scalar type bigint

Enter size of square matrix M: Enter entries of M:  M = 
[[1,2,3,0],
[4,5,6,0],
[7,8,9,0],
[0,0,0,0]]
Trace(M) = 15

Enter number of times to repeat kernel tests: kernel(m) has basis
[[1,0],
[-2,0],
[1,0],
[0,1]]
pivots: [3,4]
denom:  1
v = [1,0,0,0] is NOT in the kernel and m*v = [1,4,7,0] --OK
v = [0,1,0,0] is NOT in the kernel and m*v = [2,5,8,0] --OK
v = [0,0,1,0] is NOT in the kernel and m*v = [3,6,9,0] --OK
v = [0,0,0,1] IS in the kernel and m*v = [0,0,0,0] --OK
Now compute kernel mod p, p = 1000000000000000000000000000057
kernel(m) has basis
