Test run of rational number procs.

gcd(4,6) = 2
q = 2/3 has denominator 3 and numerator 2
Enter a rational (either n or n/d): q = 41/152 has denominator 152 and numerator 41
floor(q) = 0
ceil(q) = 1
Enter three rationals separated by whitespace: q1 = 1/3	q2 = 1/2	q3 = 2/3
Enter three rationals in the format [q1:q2:q3]: [q1:q2:q3] = [1/6:1/3:1/2]
