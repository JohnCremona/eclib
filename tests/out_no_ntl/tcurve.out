Enter a curve: 
The curve is [0,0,1,-7,6]
A test of invariants:
The curve is [0,0,1,-7,6]
b2 = 0	 b4 = -14	 b6 = 25	 b8 = -49
c4 = 336		c6 = -5400
disc = 5077	(# real components = 2)
#torsion not yet computed

The minimal curve is [0,0,1,-7,6] (reduced minimal model)
b2 = 0	 b4 = -14	 b6 = 25	 b8 = -49
c4 = 336		c6 = -5400
disc = 5077	(# real components = 2)
#torsion not yet computed
