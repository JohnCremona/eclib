Input a point on curve, [0] to finish:
Input a curve: 

Testing points on the curve [0,0,1,-7,6]
The points are P0 = [0:2:1], P1 = [1:0:1], and P2 = [2:0:1]
Their negatives are -P0 = [0:-3:1], -P1 = [1:-1:1], and -P2 = [2:-1:1]
Computing their heights:
Heights are 0.990906, 0.668205, and 0.767043
The origin is [0:1:0]
Now some additions etc,:
P0 + P1 = [3:3:1]
P0 - P1 = [8:21:1]
P0 - P1 - P2 = [93:-143:27]
P0.twice() = [245:-32:125]
P0 + P0 = [245:-32:125]
3*P0 = [-74725:-438957:117649]
P0 - P0 = [0:1:0]
P0 +3 P1 - P2 = [816:-23310:1]
2P0 +2 P1 + P2 = [93:896:1]
P0 -P1 -P2 = [93:-143:27]
	 with height 3.51888
2 (P0 -P1 -P2) = [936156018:-10370368:469097433]
	 with height 14.0755
The quotient is 4
3 (P0 -P1 -P2) = [141154686087724689336:364929251737439849995:18067866971533021791]
	 with height 31.6699
The quotient is 9
The regulator of P0, P1, P2 is 0.417144
