egr bound = 0
Shift by 1: [0,3,1,-4,0]:	CPS bound 2 = 0
Shift by 2 (up by 1): [0,6,1,5,0]:	CPS bound = 0.343561
Shift by 0 (down by 1): [0,0,1,-7,6]:	CPS bound = 0
No significant improvement (margin of 0.01)!
Best shift by 1: Best CPS bound = 0
Overall, CPS is better for 1 curves out of 1
For 100% of curves the new bound is better.
