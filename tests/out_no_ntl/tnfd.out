Split into W-eigenspaces (0/1)? 
Multiplicity 1 eigenspaces only (0/1)? 
Use just one T_p (1) or a linear combination (0)? 
Computing T_p for p = 2...done.

NTL char poly square-free factors = [[[-3 28 -54 -54 47 22 -13 -2 1] 1]]
Factors of multiplicity 1 are:
1:	[-3 1]	(degree 1)
2:	[-1 3 4 1]	(degree 3)
3:	[-1 6 -1 -3 1]	(degree 4)
Enter factor number: Degree = 4
(unscaled) min poly = [1 -3 -1 6 -1 ]
(rescaled) min poly = [-1 6 -1 -3 1]
finished constructing S, now restricting T_p to S
done.  now combining S and SW
4*Matrix of T(2) restricted to S is [-4,8,4,0;0,4,0,8;-4,4,8,-4;-4,8,4,4]

The former poly is the min poly of alpha_1 = 4*alpha
The latter is the min poly of alpha, which is the eigenvalue of T(2)
Finished computing (dual) subspace S
S has denom 4, cumulative denom = 4
