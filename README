In addition to the generic installation instructions given in the
INSTALL file, note the following.  You can see all options to
configure by typing ./configure --help.

1. The configure script will check or the existence of gmp and will
fail if it does not find it.

2. Both NTL and PARI are required.  If they have not been installed in
a place where the system will find them automatically (such as
/usr/local) then you will need to specify where they are when you
configure, like this:

./configure --with-pari=<path> --with-ntl=<path>

If you have Sage installed in SAGE_ROOT then you can use
$SAGE_ROOT/local for both of these.

3. By default a lot of programs, including test programs, are built
and will be installed by "make install".  We only provide one option
here:  if you do

./configure --disable-allprogs

then the only program built will be mwrank.  (The whole eclib library
will always be built).

3. After running make, "make check" will build and run a lot of test
programs (in the subdirectory tests) and check that they give the
expected output (using test input files in tests/in and comparing with
the expected outputs in tests/out).

4. "make install" will install header files, library files, and test
program binaries in subdirectories include, lib, bin in /usr/local by
default, so that you would need to run "make install" with superuser
privileges).  You can specify an alternative place either by adding
--prefix=<path> to the ./configure command line.
