J = 0
Bad primes: [ 2 3 157 ]
Attempting to minimize the quartic.
First partial minimization without assuming local solvability:
p=2: minimal already
p=3: minimal already
p=157: minimal already
Result has coefficients: (-33,-2159,-52689,-568174,-2282844)
I = 73947
J = 0
Bad primes: [ 2 3 157 ]
Now check local solvability:
Everywhere locally soluble
Final minimization of I, J:
p=2: minimal already
p=3: minimal already
p=157: minimal already
Result has coefficients: (-33,-2159,-52689,-568174,-2282844)
I = 73947
J = 0
Bad primes: [ 2 3 157 ]
transform = [1,0;0,1] / 1
Attempting to reduce the quartic.
Finished reducing g, new coefficients: (-33,-47,255,434,132)
I = 73947
J = 0
extra reducing transform = [-17,-18;1,1]
total transform = [-17,-18;1,1] / 1
OK
