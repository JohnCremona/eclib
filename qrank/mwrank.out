Curve [0,1,1,-2,0] :	Basic pair: I=112, J=-1712
disc=2688768
2-adic index bound = 2
By Lemma 5.1(a), 2-adic index = 1
2-adic index = 1
One (I,J) pair
Looking for quartics with I = 112, J = -1712
Looking for Type 2 quartics:
Trying positive a from 1 up to 2 (square a first...)
(1,0,-8,4,4)	--nontrivial...(x:y:z) = (1 : 1 : 0)
Point = [1:0:1]
	height = 0.476711659343739
Rank of B=im(eps) increases to 1
Trying positive a from 1 up to 2 (...then non-square a)
Trying negative a from -1 down to -1
Finished looking for Type 2 quartics.
Looking for Type 1 quartics:
Trying positive a from 1 up to 3 (square a first...)
(1,0,4,12,8)	--nontrivial...(x:y:z) = (1 : 1 : 0)
Point = [-1:1:1]
	height = 0.686667083305586
Rank of B=im(eps) increases to 2 (The previous point is on the egg)
Exiting search for Type 1 quartics after finding one which is globally soluble.
Mordell rank contribution from B=im(eps) = 2
Selmer  rank contribution from B=im(eps) = 2
Sha     rank contribution from B=im(eps) = 0
Mordell rank contribution from A=ker(eps) = 0
Selmer  rank contribution from A=ker(eps) = 0
Sha     rank contribution from A=ker(eps) = 0
Rank = 2
Searching for points (bound = 8)...done:
  found points of rank 2
  and regulator 0.152460177943144
Processing points found during 2-descent...done:
  now regulator = 0.152460177943144
Saturating (bound = 100)...done:
  points were already saturated.

Generator 1 is [0:-1:1]; height 0.327000773651605
Generator 2 is [-1:1:1]; height 0.686667083305586

Regulator = 0.152460177943144

The rank and full Mordell-Weil basis have been determined unconditionally.
