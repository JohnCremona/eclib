This directory contains some useful scripts for viewing the contents
of newforms files as created by programs in the g0n series (see
../docs/g0n.txt), which are by default in the subdirectory "newforms"
of the directory in which those programs are run.

For each level N (a positive integer) the file newforms/xN contains
data in binary format.  The scripts are not sophisticated, and just
give a shell error if that file does not exists.

./nnf N  shows the number of (rational) newforms at level N
./nap N  shows the number of a_p stored
./showdata N shows all the auxiliary data
./showeigs N shows all the a_q and a_p
./shownf N   shows all the above
