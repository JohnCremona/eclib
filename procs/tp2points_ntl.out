Test program for P2Point class
Point input formats are [x:y:z], [x,y], [x/z,y/z] with any type of brackets
Enter a point P: P=[78:1292:221]
output_pari(P) = [6/17,1292/221]
P==P? 1
After P=P2Point(2,4,-6), P=[-1:-2:3]
After Q=P, Q=[-1:-2:3]
After Q=transform(P,3,4,5,6,0), Q=[-13:15:27]
After R=transform(Q,3,4,5,6,1), R=[-1:-2:3]
R==P? 1
Projective coordinates of P are X=-1, Y=-2, Z=3
Affine coordinates of P are X=-1/3, Y=-2/3
Real affine coordinates of P are X=-0.333333, Y=-0.666667
P.isintegral()? 0
